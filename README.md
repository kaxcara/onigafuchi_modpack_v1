## Onigafuchi Minecraft Modpack 
This git repository is to ensure compatibility with installed mods on client with mods of the server.

Server Version: 1.19.2

Server Address: onigafuchi.ddns.net 


## Notice
If you are installing mods to an instance that has already been imported, the jar files of the mods have been provided as well as the config. **DO NOT** try to import from the zip found here, as Xaero's world map exploration and waypoint data will not carry over. 
This is because Xaero's world map data saves within the client computer instead of on the server. If you are migrating to another computer, remember to transfer map data from the previous computer to the one being migrated to.


If you want to download them individually, mods zip and config zip are found in this link:

Make sure to export each into their respective folder.
