## Notice
If you are installing mods to an instance that has already been imported, the jar files of the mods have been provided as well as the config. **DO NOT** try to import from the zip, as minimap data will not carry over. 


Instead export over from mods zip and config zip found here:

Make sure to export into each in their respective folder.
