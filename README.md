## Onigafuchi Minecraft Modpack 
This git repository is to ensure compatibility with installed mods on client with mods of the server.

Server Version: 1.19.2
Server Address: onigafuchi.ddns.net 


## Notice
If you are installing mods to an instance that has already been imported, the jar files of the mods have been provided as well as the config. **DO NOT** try to import from the zip found here, as Xaero's world map exploration and waypoint data will not carry over. 


Instead export over from mods zip and config zip found on the Google Drive: 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15WM0XKTzM5Q73aRj62aBBCUzkjpodqa4?usp=drive_link

Make sure to export each into their respective folder.
